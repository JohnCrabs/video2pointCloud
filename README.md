# video2pointCloud
You read a folder which contains video files then export the video to images. Then you read the images and create a pointCloud.

Each of the above .py files can be used as a solo library to perform certain processes. 

This repository is a little outdated. The point cloud which I create is using depth map and its not so accurate. CrabSfm repository uses 
the structure form motion algorithm and creates better results.
